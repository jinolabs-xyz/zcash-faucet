# node:22-slim, so every green suite was green on a runtime that does not exist in
# production. It fixed the five pins in ci.yml. It did not fix live-smoke.yml, which
# was still on 23, and nothing noticed for the same reason nothing noticed the first
# time: the agreement was a convention, not a check.
#
# That is the fourth detector-before-actor case in this repo. Fixing the instances you
# can see leaves the next one to be found by an incident. So the RULE gets encoded
# here, and it costs one grep per workflow.
